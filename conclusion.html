      <p style="font-family: 'Handlee';">
        The statistics show that a majority of Americans support the legalization. Either reclassifying or legalizing would allow for increase in tax revenue for many states and allow for many more treatments for diseases that we don't have currently. Hemp would also be able to revitalize smaller farms in agriculture and allow for a more renewable source of paper and rope among other things.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p style="font-family: 'Handlee';">
        Popular media has also shown the support for legalization. The benefits of this movement is also shown through the many songs and videos surrounding the topic. Overall, political cartoonists, comedians, video makers, and music artists all have their own views and opinions on the issues and they do have a significant impact on how the public views the issue.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h2 style="font-family: 'Permanent Marker';">Overall, marijuana really isn't as bad as it is made out to be and legalization can only serve to improve many systems through tax revenue and help protect our citizens from addiction and awful substances being cut with the marijuana. It also could prevent uses of other drugs and allows for drug prices to come down, especially for things like chemotherapy.</h2>
